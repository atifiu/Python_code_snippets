map: applied only on series and can be elemntwise only
applymap: applied only on dataframe and elementwise only
apply: both for series and dataframe and it will be on whole dataset and hence axis needs to be defined

Summing up, apply works on a row / column basis of a DataFrame, applymap works element-wise on a DataFrame, and map works element-wise on a Series.
